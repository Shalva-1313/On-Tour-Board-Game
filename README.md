# On-Tour-Board-Game
The user's goal is to go through the route that allows them to achieve the biggest score.

This project implements a **dynamic programming** algorithm to solve a scoring problem from the board game *On Tour*.  
Given a completed game board, the program outputs:
- **Maximum possible score** achievable.
- **Tour path** that yields this score.

This was developed as part of **CS 590 – Spring 2025, Project 2**.

## Problem Description
In *On Tour*, players fill a map with numbers and aim to form the **longest increasing tour**:
- Numbers must **strictly increase** along the path.
- Some spaces are **circled** (worth double points).
- No wildcards or equal-valued adjacent spaces (restricted version).
- Some spaces may be unusable and are omitted from the board.


---

## 📂 Input Format
The program reads from `input.txt`:

1. **First line**: Integer `n` – number of spaces.
2. **Next n lines**:  

- `value` → Number assigned to the space.
- `points` → Point value (1 or 2).
- `neighbors_count` → Number of connected spaces.
- `neighbor_i` → IDs of neighboring spaces (1-indexed).

**Example:**
Meaning:
- Value = 21  
- Points = 2 (circled)  
- 2 neighbors: spaces 6 and 7

## 📤 Output Format
The program writes to `output.txt`:
1. **Line 1** → Maximum score (integer).
2. **Line 2** → Space IDs of the maximum-scoring tour in order.

---

## 🛠 Approach
- Uses **dynamic programming** with memoization.
- **State** → Current space & last visited value.
- **Transition** → Move to connected spaces with higher values, accumulate points.
- Final implementation is **iterative DP** for efficiency.
